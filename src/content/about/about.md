i’m a software engineer with 10+ years building backend systems, platforms, and 
distributed services. i like working where performance, security, and developer
experience overlap.

i grew up in southern california and ended up in oregon, where life is a mix of 
family, outdoors, and whatever new hobby i’m messing with. i also spent 13
years in the u.s. army reserve, ending as a platoon sergeant, which taught me
a great deal about leading teams and staying steady under pressure.

i care about building platforms that feel simple, powerful, and welcoming to 
developers of all experience levels.
