`cardmod-rs`, or cardmod, is your ultimate finaly fantasy viii (8) companion.

cardmod gives you insights into how many and of which kinds of triple triad
cards are required to yield N number of magic.

## happy trees

[finaly fantasy 8](#final-fantasy-8) is a great game. i've played it through 
twice now. both play-throughs were such beautifully frustrating experiences.

i love the story, the characters, the hope of conquering charlatan political
figures - it's utterly fascinating.

BUT, holy piss demons batman - it's such a frustrating playthough due to 
terribly inconsistent power level expectations. after the second playthrough i 
promised i wouldn't make another pass without capitalizing on each opportunity
to power up each of my characters as much as possible, as early as possible.

my hope is that this yields a seamless, story-rich experience much like that of
Halo. i've dubbed this variant of playthough the "happy trees" experience.

if you'd like to learn more about the game, triple-triad, or why there's a card
game inside of another game - read our [finaly fantasy 8](#final-fantasy-8)
