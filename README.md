# about me

hey dude, i’m nick. 👋

i’m a software engineer with over a decade of experience building scalable,
high-performance backend systems and platform services that empower teams to
move faster. my focus spans identity & access management, developer tooling,
and distributed systems. i’m passionate about designing solutions that
balance security, efficiency, and experience - so that both teams and customers
can focus on building value rather than wrestling with infrastructure.

i grew up in southern california - surfing, music, and hockey shaped my younger
years. toward the end of my schooling, my family moved to oregon. today, i
split my time between family, outdoor adventures, and checking out new hands-on
hobbies. i’m always experimenting, tinkering, and learning, whether it's
trying out a new framework or language, building out my homelab, and trying to
100% my favorite games.

alongside my tech journey, i served 13 years in the u.s. army reserves, most
recently as a platoon sergeant (e-6) in a bridge company. that experience
instilled leadership, discipline, and high-stakes problem-solving skills
that i carry into every engineering challenge.

**professional experience:**  
- **ngrok:** building world-class, developer-first networking infrastructure
  at scale.  
- **kong inc.:** built globally distrubted and scalable platforms for the
konnect, including identity & access management, audit logging with siem
  integrations, and organic search.
- **nike:** enabled teams to deploy applications reliably and securely at
  enterprise scale by providing self-service access to fully managed
  k8s-backed environments. my first journey into people management, leading a 
  team to drive platform strategy and design patterns across the enterprise.
- **u.s. bank:** started as a junior sre, system admin we called it, managing
  enterprise content systems and deploying physical search nodes for call 
  center and public search workloads.

i believe inclusion is a technical choice as much as a cultural one. i aim to
design platforms that meet people where they are, reduce hidden complexity,
and create space for developers of all experience levels to contribute with
confidence.

let’s connect 🤘
