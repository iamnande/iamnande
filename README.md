# About Me

Hey dude! I'm Nick. ðŸ‘‹

I've been in the tech world for a bit now, primarily building Backend Software for central Platform teams. 
When I'm not working - you can usually find me spending time with my family, hitting the outdoors, or trying to find yet-another-hobby (YAH).

I grew up in Southern California, so the beach, surfing, and (somehow) hockey were huge parts of my life.
My family moved to Oregon before I became an adult; we really do hug trees around here - it's super fun.
These days - when I'm not spending time my family, you'll find me backpacking, hunting, on the ice or adventuring.

I served in the Army Reserves for 13 years, most recently as a Platoon Sergeant (E-6) in a Bridge Platoon. 
I officially wrapped up my military career in 2023 - but the leadership, discipline, and dynamic problem-solving I picked up during my time in service have definitely carried over into my tech career.

Professionally I've been busy in the software engineering world.
I'm currently at ngrok helping build world-class developer-first networking infrastructure.
Before that - I was at Kong Inc. where I helped build and lead platform design and deliver high-performance platforms that powered globally-distributed systems.
I've also had the chance to work at Nike, where I helped build next-gen tools and platforms for large-scale deployments and building up the shared developer experience tooling and automation deployed across multiple tech organizations.
I owe my start in this industry to Dave McCall at U.S. Bank - I was effectively a junior SRE engineer, or System Administrator with a limited scope and fierce automation requirements, for an Enterprise Content Management system (learning from OG TeamSite folks). 
While there, I also had the opportunity to deploy phsyical Google search nodes to support call center data and public usbank.com search - yes, the chassis really are yellow.

Learning is such a huge part of who I am - whether it's reading books, watching YouTube tutorials & reviews, or hands-on tinkering. 
I'm a visual learner, so I like to get my hands dirty and experiment with new ideas.
Even with all the work, I'm nerdy enough to describe my learning as though I'm shamelessy gathering new magic to junction to different character stats to OP my favorite game character - Squall from Finally Fantasy 8.
I'm always trying to squeeze in more reading (currently reading Leviathan Wakes by James S. A. Corey and Open Veins of Latin America by Eduardo Galeano).

Between family, work and dreams of building a next-generation farm in the Midwest someday, days are always exciting!
