  title: about me
  description: |
    i’ve been building software for over a decade, mostly back-end systems and
    platform services that help teams move faster without tripping over
    infrastructure. my sweet spots are identity & access, developer tooling, and
    distributed systems. i’m all about designing stuff that’s secure, efficient,
    and just feels right to use — so devs can actually focus on building cool
    things instead of wrestling with servers and configs.
